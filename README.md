    // Voice only works in guilds, if the message does not come from a guild,
    // we ignore it
try {
    if (!message.guild) return;

    if (message.content.startsWith('/play')) {
        // Only try to join the sender's voice channel if they are in one themselves
        if (message.member.voice.channel) {
            const connection = await message.member.voice.channel.join();
            const args = message.content.split(' ').slice(1)
            const ytdl = require('ytdl-core')
            connection.play(ytdl(args.join(" ")))
        } else {
            message.reply('You need to join a voice channel first!');
